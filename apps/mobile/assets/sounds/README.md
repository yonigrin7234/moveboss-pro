## Guidelines

1. **Keep sounds subtle** - Volume should be moderate, not jarring
2. **Professional tone** - Sounds should feel premium, not gamey
3. **Short duration** - Most sounds should be under 500ms
4. **Consistent style** - All sounds should feel cohesive
5. **License** - Ensure sounds are royalty-free or properly licensed
